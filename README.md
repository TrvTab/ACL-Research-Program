# ACL-Research-Program


Created an interface using Python to facilitate reading of MRI scans for ACL surgery decision-making.


Program takes a screenshot then allows user to plot 10 points on the image. In practice, the image is an MRI of an ACL. The points are then used to create a power trendline. 

This program was started in 2018.
